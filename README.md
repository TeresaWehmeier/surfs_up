# Surfs-Up: A Business Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to determine if a surf board rental and ice cream shop is sustainable throughout the year on the island of Oahu. Specifically, weather data in the months of June and December between 2010 and 2017 are analyzed for temperature variances and if temperature statistics in those two months are comparable.

## Results
Two deliverables were created to analyze the data, including
- Temperature readings during the month of June
- Temperature readings during the month of December

### June Statistics
There are 1700 observations recorded in the month of June, and 1517 observations recorded in the month of December for all years in the data set. There are 11% fewer observations made in the month of December, overall. Temperature varies 3 - 4&deg;F between the two months, which suggests a fairly minimal temperature swing throughout the year.

In the month of June, temperatures recorded range from a minimum of 64&deg;F to a maximum of 85&deg;F, or a range of 21&deg;F for the month. The mean is 75&deg;F, and the median is 75&deg;F.

### December Statistics
In the month of December, temperatures recorded range from a minimum of 56&deg;F to a maximum of 83&deg;F, or a range of 27&deg;F for the month. The mean is 71&deg;F, and the median is 71&deg;F.

### Distinctions Between Deliverables
Comparing the two data deliverables, the three key distinctions between the two months include:
- Fewer observations are made in December than in June, even though there are more days in December
- The temperature range in June is only 21&deg;F compared to 27&deg;F in December, which suggests more cooler days are recorded in December
- The mean and median temperatures are the same for both June and December - 75&deg;F and 71&deg;F respectively, suggesting the data is consistent and relatively predictable

## Summary
Overall, temperature variations between June and December are relatively low, with a variance of only 3-4&deg;F between the two months. Based on these results, the overall impact on the business model for surf board rentals is minimal; however, ice cream sales may experience a decline during the winter months on the island,
